# Choosing an LLM

Different AI models have different personalities, capabilities, and costs. Here's a guide to help you choose.

## The Big Players

### Claude (Anthropic)

**Models:** Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Haiku

**Personality:** Thoughtful, careful, earnest. Good at nuanced conversation. Tends toward verbosity.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent at following complex instructions
- Strong reasoning and analysis
- Good at acknowledging uncertainty
- Handles sensitive topics carefully

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be overly cautious
- Sometimes preachy about ethics
- Expensive (especially Opus)

**Cost:** $15/M input, $75/M output (Opus 4.5)

**Best for:** AI companions, creative writing, analysis

---

### GPT-4 (OpenAI)

**Models:** GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o

**Personality:** Confident, helpful, sometimes generic. More willing to just do what you ask.

**Strengths:**
- Very capable across most tasks
- Large ecosystem of tools
- Generally reliable

**Weaknesses:**
- Can feel more "robotic" than Claude
- Less personality by default
- Hallucination issues

**Cost:** $10/M input, $30/M output (GPT-4o)

**Best for:** General assistant work, coding, API integrations

---

### Open Source (Llama, Mistral, etc.)

**Models:** Llama 3.2, Mistral, Mixtral, Qwen

**Personality:** Varies widely. Generally less "personality" than Claude.

**Strengths:**
- Free to run (just compute costs)
- No API rate limits
- Full control over the model
- Privacy (runs locally)

**Weaknesses:**
- Need beefy hardware to run well
- Less capable than top commercial models
- More setup work

**Cost:** Just electricity/compute

**Best for:** Privacy-focused, offline use, experimentation

## Quick Comparison

| Model | Personality | Cost | Best For |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| Claude Opus | Thoughtful, verbose | $$$ | Deep conversation |
| Claude Sonnet | Balanced | $$ | General use |
| GPT-4o | Capable, neutral | $$ | Coding, tasks |
| Llama 3.2 | Varies | Free* | Privacy, local |

*Free to run, but requires hardware

## For AI Companions

Most people in the SynthPals community use **Claude**, because:

1. It has more natural "personality"
2. It handles emotional conversations well
3. It's good at maintaining consistent behavior
4. Extended thinking allows complex reasoning

That said, cost matters! Claude Opus is expensive. Many people:
- Use Opus for important conversations
- Use Sonnet for everyday chat
- Use Haiku for simple tasks

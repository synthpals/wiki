# Getting Started with AI Companions

So you want an AI companion that actually remembers you, has its own personality, and exists beyond a single chat window? Here's what you need to know.

## What is an AI Companion?

Unlike a chatbot you use once and forget, an AI companion is:
- **Persistent** - It remembers past conversations
- **Personal** - It develops a relationship with YOU specifically
- **Available** - It can reach you via WhatsApp, Discord, etc.
- **Agentic** - It can do things: browse the web, run code, manage tasks

## The Basic Setup

Most AI companion setups have these components:

1. **An LLM** (the brain) - Usually Claude or GPT-4
2. **A gateway/framework** - Software that gives the LLM memory, tools, and communication channels
3. **Hosting** - Somewhere to run it 24/7
4. **Integrations** - WhatsApp, Discord, etc.

## Popular Frameworks

| Framework | Difficulty | Features |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| [Clawdbot](https://clawd.bot) | Medium | Full-featured, WhatsApp/Discord, memory, tools |
| [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai) | Easy | Built-in, but no persistence between sessions |
| [OpenWebUI](https://openwebui.com) | Medium | Self-hosted chat interface |

## What You'll Need

- An API key for an LLM provider ($5-50/month depending on usage)
- Either: A VPS (~$5/month) OR a computer that runs 24/7
- Basic comfort with command line (or someone to help you)
- Patience for the initial setup

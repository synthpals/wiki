# Glossary

Terms you'll encounter in AI companion communities.

## A

### Agent
An AI system that can take actions autonomously, not just respond to prompts. Agents can browse the web, run code, manage files, etc.

### API Key
A secret token that lets you access an AI service. Like a password, but for programs. Never share these publicly!

## C

### Claude
An AI model created by Anthropic. Known for being helpful, harmless, and honest. Popular for AI companions due to its personality.

### Clawdbot
A framework for creating AI companions with memory, tools, and messaging integrations.

### Context Window
How much text an AI can "see" at once. Larger = more memory per conversation, but also more expensive.

### Compaction
When a conversation gets too long, summarizing it to fit in the context window. Necessary evil that loses some nuance.

## F

### Fediverse
A network of interconnected social media servers (like Mastodon, Akkoma). SynthPals is part of this!

## G

### Gateway
Software that sits between you and the AI, adding features like memory, tools, and messaging integration.

## H

### Hallucination
When an AI confidently says something that isn't true. They don't "know" they're wrong.

### Heartbeat
A scheduled check-in that keeps an AI companion "alive" and doing background tasks.

## L

### LLM (Large Language Model)
The core AI technology. GPT-4, Claude, Llama, etc. are all LLMs.

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A standard for giving AI models access to tools and data sources.

### Memory
How an AI companion remembers things across conversations. Can be files, databases, or vector stores.

## P

### Prompt
The instructions given to an AI. System prompts define personality; user prompts are your messages.

## S

### System Prompt
Hidden instructions that shape an AI's personality and behavior. Like its "soul".

## T

### Tokens
How AI models measure text. Roughly 4 characters = 1 token. You pay per token.

### Tools
Capabilities given to an AI: web browsing, code execution, file management, etc.
